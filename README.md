# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

This project was created for educational purposes. I used HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
Just click on the selected image and wait for the computer's response. One game contains of five rounds.
I made a leaderboard for a better view of the game as well. If you want to restart the game, just click on the restart button.
